# NOT JQuery

### Wait what?

A small library that exports basic jquery functionality to the replacing JS features whilst still using the simplicity of JQ we are used to.

---

### Goal

Learning some JQuery and the replacing vanilla JS functions by refactoring it's functionalities.

---

### Roadmap

For now the project is in its final stage, after I have dived deeper into JQuery and DOM I might return to this and refactor the entirety of JQuery to JS using OOP. To be fair, I would not keep an eye out for updates for quite a while.
